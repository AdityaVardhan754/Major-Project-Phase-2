Amyloid proteins are associated with a great variety of human diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinsonâ€™s, and type2diabetes. Certain vegetables and food items can help the humans to prevent such diseases by controlling the deposition of Amyloid proteins. Vegetables includes onions, kale, romaine lettuce, cabbage, and tomatoes. Other food items like walnuts, coffee, Berries, Fatty Fish, Turmeric, Champagne and Cinnamon also help in the control of diseases that are caused by the deposition of Amyloids. In this project, an attempt is made to predict Amyloid Proteins by considering a dataset comprising of the above mentioned food items. This data analysis is carried out by using Gradient Boosting Classifier and Neural Net Analysis. The project comprises of four modules. The first module deals with building GBC model and finding its Accuracy. The second module deals with the predictions of GBC model. The third module comprises of building the neural net and finding its accuracy. The fourth module deals with finding the predictions with the neural net model.
