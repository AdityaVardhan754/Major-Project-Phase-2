This section showcases our project's functionality through a series of steps.

Note: Make sure that you have installed python and necessary libraries related to the code. 

Executing the Application:
1. Launch the Command Prompt as Administrative.
2. Navigate to the Project Directory: This step instructs the program on location of the necessary files.
3. Run the File amlyproteinl1.py: Executing this file initiates the application.

Upon program execution, the "Amyloid Proteins Prediction Tool" window launches. This interface comprises four distinct modules:
•Gradient Boosting Accuracy: This section displays the model's overall accuracy in predicting amyloid protein level.
•Gradient Boosting Prediction: This module showcases the model's predicted amyloid protein levels of user.
•Neural Network Accuracy: This section presents the accuracy of the neural network model in predicting amyloid protein levels.
•Neural Network Prediction: This module displays the neural network model's predicted amyloid protein levels of user.
